# StudyTime

StudyTime is an extremely flexible Android Flashcard app. 

Although StudyTime comes with over 1,000 pre-loaded questions in several different Categories, it also makes creating or uploading your own questions a snap!

You can quiz yourself however you want: In the pre-loaded Elements category, you can quiz yourself:
- By Atmoic Symbol (name the element)
- By Atomic Number (name the element)
- By Element (name the Atomic Symbol and/or Atomic Number)

Just switch the fields within the app, and you are good to go!

## User Data

Study Time will not track any personally identifiable user data. Third-party advertising apps such as Ad Mob may perform such tracking. Study time WILL potentially track some non-personal information in order to help improve the app, such as:
- Rough (city-level) user location
- General information (category only) of what users are studying

In order to make the uploading and downloading of questions as seamless as possible, Study Time will request access to your Google Drive and Google Spreadsheets accounts, *ONLY IF* you agree and choose to use this functionality. 
If you provide this access, Study Time will use it to:
- Offer you a list of files (Google Sheets Documents) available for import into Study Time
- Read the contents of the chosen file
- Allow you to create a new file (or update an existing one) in order to save your questions outside of the app.

Study Time will ONLY update or change Google Sheets files, and ONLY those files that you have directly chosen from within the app. All Google Sheets files are version controlled, so any unwanted changes can always be rolled back!
